            <h2>Advantages of Web Developer</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><h3>Short Education Time</h3></li>
                <p>
                    Becoming a web developer may only take just a short training period 
                    before starting your career. Some employers may ask for an associate's
                    degree in web design or a related field before hiring you. You may even
                    find online training schools that could provide you with a relevant
                    degree you can earn while you work.
                </p>
                <li><h3>Salary</h3></li>
                <p>
                    Web developers earn an average salary of $67,225 per year. Your salary may also
                    increase as you gain experience in your field. Individuals with six to nine years
                    of experience may earn up to $78,436 per year, average, while those with over 10
                    years of experience may earn $85,472 per year on average. You may earn more by 
                    advancing to management positions as well.
                </p>
                <li><h3>High creative potential</h3></li>
                <p>
                    If you want a career in which you can express your creativity, you may enjoy
                    being a web developer. Coding provides a unique creative platform as it allows 
                    you to design different aspects of a website, such as creating visual site 
                    layouts. Some web developers may also use web design programs to produce creative
                    artwork, like logos and branding art, for use on their clients' websites.
                </p>
                <li><h3>Ability to work in various work environments</h3></li>
                <p>
                    Web developers may work in several environments based on their position. You may
                    work in an office with other developers and designers when creating new web pages.
                    You may also work from home and use shared programming platforms to work 
                    remotely with your coworkers. These diverse options mean you could work wherever
                    you feel most productive.
                </p>
                <li><h3>Career growth</h3></li>
                <p>
                    Web developers may find many growth opportunities within their field that could 
                    expand their earnings and improve their development experience. You may also 
                    transition to management positions in your company later in your career. Management 
                    positions usually pay a higher salary and focus more on planning instead of hands-on
                    programming tasks.

            <h2>Disadvantages of Web Developer</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><h3>Requires coding knowledge</h3></li>
                <p>
                    Web developing careers usually require learning the multiple programming codes used
                    for creating websites. Some people may find this process time-consuming or difficult
                    to master. Having this coding experience can allow you to transition to other
                    tech-related careers if you decide you want to try something new, such as programming 
                    video games or apps.
                </p>
                <li><h3>Includes long hours</h3></li>
                <p>
                    Web developers may spend eight to 10 hours every day programming, depending on their
                    position. They may even work on the weekends polishing their coding. Some individuals
                    may enjoy these long work hours and use downtime within them to expand their careers.
                    This may include programming smartphone apps during breaks or reading books while
                    waiting for programming tests to finish. People who like to program may also find these 
                    long hours very enjoyable.
                </p>
                <li><h3>Involves a high-pressure environment</h3></li>
                <p>
                    Some web development careers involve high-pressure environments that may require tight
                    deadlines and challenging delivery schedules. These high-pressure situations may 
                    frustrate some developers, while others might thrive in it. People who enjoy fast-paced
                    work may find web development enjoyable, as they may enjoy meeting tight deadlines and
                    solving problems before they occur.
                </p>
                <li><h3>Requires teamwork</h3></li>
                <p>
                    Web developers may work with other developers and designers when producing new web 
                    designs. Some people may prefer to work alone, as they would like to have full control
                    over their project. Collaboration helps developers identify solutions they wouldn't 
                    have thought of themselves and helps them learn things they otherwise might not have 
                    if they were working alone.
                </p>
                <li><h3>Requires consistent changes to meet best practice guidelines</h3></li>
                <p>
                    Successful web developers may find themselves constantly updating old and new websites
                    to meet recent best practices guidelines. While some web developers may prefer other
                    duties, others may enjoy fine-tuning their creations and finding new ways to enhance 
                    them. They may find this steady work enjoyable and find satisfaction in creating the
                    best website they can. Others may find this work improves their skills as it provides
                    more coding practice.
